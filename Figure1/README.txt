This folder contains the code to replicate Figure 1 in Analysis of data-augmentation samplers for high-dimensional probit regression (Ascolani and Zanella).

It includes the following files:

- "Functions_cpupling.R", which contains the functions to implement all the couplings.

- "Simulations_Figure1.R", which contains the code to replicate Figure 1.


See Section 6 for the details of the simulation.

NOTE: all the files admits the possibility of generating imbalanced data (first row of Figure 1) or data generated from the model (second row of Figure 1). In the code this is highlighted by the comment "#generate the y: COMMENT THE ONE YOU DO NOT USE"
